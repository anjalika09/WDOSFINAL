            <h2>Dinning</h2>
            <p class="a">Nestled between the hills and rainforest in the heart of Sri Lanka, Santani exists for the singular purpose of nourishing your soul.
                 When it comes to actual nutrition, we believe balance rather than extremes, and in the value of pleasure in our lives. 
                 Whether you like juicing, vegetarian, vegan and raw foods or you prefer heartier traditional fare, Santani is about freedom and choices which are yours to make among our nutritious and 
                 delicious food served in our elevated restaurant with capacity for 60 guests and at our open-air main pavilion lounge with its biodynamic wine & fresh juice bar
                Your experience at Santani includes a personalised approach to gourmet wellness cuisine.
                 In place of a printed menu for everyone, Santani’s experienced, internationally trained chefs prepare your healthy natural dishes according to a custom meal plan created in co-ordination with the Head of Wellness and Santani’s in-house Ayurvedic doctor based upon your health goals and physical condition.
                  Personalised meal plans draw upon the most recent scientific research in three main areas</p>

                   <p>Our low-carbohydrate Keto meal plan comprises certified meat, freshly caught seafood and garden fresh vegetables, most from our own organic garden. 
                     Santani does not use any processed or refined foods and the Keto diet excludes starch-rich foods such as rice, breads, yams and pasta.
                     The Keto Diet substitutes carbohydrates for healthy fats, so that the body instead of storing fat, the body begins to burn ketones as the main energy source and stored fat will be burned away.</p>

                    <p>Santani’s modern approach to the traditional Sri Lanka Ayurveda diet comprises fresh foods representing the six Ayurvedic tastes – sweet, salty, sour, pungent, bitter, and astringent. 
                    Every one of us is born with a unique balance of these doshas; every activity and function of our mind and body is dependent upon the balanced or unbalanced state of our doshas. 
                    This diet, designed to cleanse the body of impurities and thus rebalance the doshas, encourages energy stimulation and calms the mind, which makes it a valuable tool in elevating mood, energy and metabolism.</p>

                    <p>The Santani approach to detox and cleansing is still very much about gourmet dining and fulfilment. Our non-juice detox diet and the raw juice & smoothies programme are restricted short term diet plans which focus on eliminating caffeine, alcohol, salt, sugar and processed foods. The purpose of this diet plan is primarily to support and cleanse the liver, intestinal tract, kidneys, lungs and skin through the elimination of toxins in the body.</p>
