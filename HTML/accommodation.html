            <h2>Rooms & Lifestyle</h2>
            <p class="a">We chose to design our contemporary dwellings based on the concept of the ‘ambalama’, which is the Sri Lankan word meaning ‘place of rest.’ Historically, pilgrims and traders moved around this sun-kissed island on foot. Simple shelters called ambalama came into being, offering these travellers somewhere safe to rest up for the next leg of a long journey. This human need to rest has not changed; today’s travellers too are in need of a place to rest up, along the journey of life.

                Stylish and utterly comfortable, our interiors too are deliberately minimal. As in ancient Buddhist meditation caves in the mountains surrounding Santani, this lack of distraction allows you to focus your mind solely on slowing it down.
                
                To further support your efforts to ‘reset,’ our rooms do not have televisions. While digital detox is a key component of the Santani experience, we do offer in-room WiFi on demand. </p>
